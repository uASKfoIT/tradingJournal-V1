# tradingJournal-V1

The goal of this full-stack application was to allow users to keep track of their trades (options and stocks) made on the US Stock Market. Version 1 served as a foundation for exploring backend/frontend integration and managing user-generated data.

Development was paused at approximately 70% completion to address code duplication, improve maintainability, and redesign the UI. Common elements like <input> fields were repeated across multiple files, which led to redundancy and made scaling difficult. These issues are being addressed and improvement will made in Version 2. 

Version 2 - Start Date: 5/20/25
Version 2 - Completion Date Goal: 6/30/25
